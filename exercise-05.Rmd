```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

First, I'm loading in the “IMDB-movies.csv” dataset as a tibble.

```{r}
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/IMDB-movies.csv"
(d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE))
```

Now I am going to filter the dataset to include just movies from 1920 to 1979 and movies that are between 1 and 3 hours long, and add a new column that codes the startYear into a new variable, decade.

```{r}
d <- d|> mutate(decade = case_when( #If...
  startYear >= 1970 ~ "70s",
  startYear >= 1960 ~ "60s",
  startYear >= 1950 ~ "50s",
  startYear >= 1940 ~ "40s",
  startYear >= 1930 ~ "30s",
  startYear >= 1920 ~ "20s", 
  TRUE ~ "NA"
))
```
